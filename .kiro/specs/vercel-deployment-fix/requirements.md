# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the Vercel deployment failure caused by incorrect output directory configuration. The deployment currently fails because Vercel cannot find the expected "public" directory after the build process completes.

## Glossary

- **Vercel Platform**: Cloud deployment platform for frontend applications
- **Output Directory**: The folder containing built static files that Vercel serves
- **Build Process**: The compilation step that transforms source code into deployable assets
- **Frontend Application**: The React/Vite-based user interface application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vercel deployment to succeed, so that the application is accessible to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process completes, THE Vercel Platform SHALL find the correct output directory containing built assets
2. THE Frontend Application SHALL build to a directory that matches Vercel's configuration
3. THE Vercel Platform SHALL serve the application without "No Output Directory" errors
4. THE Build Process SHALL complete successfully on Vercel's infrastructure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build configuration to be consistent, so that local and production builds work identically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend Application SHALL use the same build output directory locally and on Vercel
2. THE Build Process SHALL produce identical directory structures in both environments
3. WHEN running build commands locally, THE Frontend Application SHALL generate the same output structure as Vercel expects
